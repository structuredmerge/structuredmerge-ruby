# kettle-jem Transferable Changelog

## Added

- kettle-jem-template-20260720-001 - READMEs can now display configured
  corporate sponsor logos.
- kettle-jem-template-20260720-005 - README Support & Community links now
  include RubyForum.
- kettle-jem-template-20260726-001 - Projects now include YARD lint
  configuration and documentation dependencies so documentation issues fail
  before generated docs are refreshed.
- kettle-jem-template-20260727-001 - Spec harness documentation now lists the
  RSpec helpers provided by `kettle-test`.

## Changed

- kettle-jem-template-20260716-002 - Gemspecs now ship fewer repository-only
  files, reducing package noise for downstream packagers.
- kettle-jem-template-20260720-002 - Development Gemfiles now use the released
  `tree_sitter_language_pack` gem 1.13.3 or newer by default.
- kettle-jem-template-20260725-002 - Version specs now use `anonymous_loader` to
  cover `version.rb` without redefining constants, or are removed when version
  specs are not managed for the project.
- kettle-jem-template-20260728-001 - Generated Ruby workflows now use clearer
  setup-ruby-flash planning and can prepare appraisal-only jobs without
  installing the main Gemfile bundle.

## Fixed

- kettle-jem-template-20260716-001 - Shim gems now package `LICENSE.md` instead
  of a missing `LICENSE.txt` file.
- kettle-jem-template-20260720-003 - StructuredMerge Git diff driver config now
  uses the installed `smorg-rb` driver command.
- kettle-jem-template-20260720-004 - MRI-only projects now omit JRuby and
  TruffleRuby workflow jobs.
- kettle-jem-template-20260725-001 - Release pull request branches beginning
  with `feature/release` now run JRuby and TruffleRuby workflows.
- kettle-jem-template-20260726-002 - Generated version files now document their
  version namespace and constants, reducing warning-only YARD lint output.
- kettle-jem-template-20260726-003 - Coverage upload steps now treat Coveralls,
  QLTY, and Codecov as optional, so provider outages do not fail CI when local
  coverage thresholds still pass.
- kettle-jem-template-20260728-002 - Generated RuboCop configs now ignore the
  same `gemfiles/vendor/bundle` tree as `.gitignore`, so vendored dependency
  installs are not reported as project lint debt.
- kettle-jem-template-20260728-003 - Generated dep-heads workflows now run
  TruffleRuby jobs with current RubyGems and Bundler, avoiding setup failures
  before the test suite starts.
- kettle-jem-template-20260728-004 - Generated dep-heads workflows now use the
  setup-ruby Bundler install path for direct appraisal Gemfiles, avoiding rv
  lockfile parser failures on Git and path dependencies.
